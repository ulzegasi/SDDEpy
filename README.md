# SDDEpy

This repository contains the scripts and data needed to run SABC inference using the Python SABC algorithm and the Python-wrapped SDDE Solar Dynamo model from Julia.

## Environment setup

Activate the project environment:

```bash
conda activate sddepy_env
```

Install the shared SDDE model package (-e -> editable means changes in that repo are immediately visible without reinstalling.):

```bash
pip install -e /Users/ulzg/SABC/SDDE-model
```
